## Getting started

This guide will teach you how to use an automated teller machine to perform basic banking functions.

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll know how to deposit a check into your bank account and use your debit card to withdraw cash.  No prior experience is necessary.

To get the most out of this guide, make sure to have the following on hand:

* **A check made out to you**
* **Your debit card**
* **Your debit card PIN number**

Youâ€™ll need all three as you follow an example use case of withdrawing funds after depositing an **old-age pension check** (OAP) into your bank account.

## Understanding ATMs

**Automated teller machines** (ATMs) allow you to carry out financial services without the assistance of bank personnel.  ATMs offer banking convenience in several situations:

* When youâ€™re unable to attend a bank during its business hours
* When youâ€™re unable to wait in line to speak with banking staff
* When communication with banking staff proves difficult

With an ATM, you can accomplish a wide range of transactions, including cash and check deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries.

## Using an ATM for the first time

Suppose you need to deposit your OAP check and then withdraw $100.  Using an ATM, you can deposit the check and withdraw cash from your account in three stages:

1. **Prepare for ATM use**
2. **Insert your debit card and check**
3. **Withdraw funds**

### Preparing for ATM use

To streamline your transaction, follow these steps **before** arriving at the ATM location:

* Confirm that the check you wish to deposit displays your legal name.
* Endorse your check by signing its back with a pen.
* Verify your debit cardâ€™s personal identification number (PIN).
* Locate the ATM youâ€™ll use for your transaction.

Youâ€™ll often find ATMs at your bankâ€™s entrance, though some branches place them in outdoor car lanes for ease of access from a vehicle.

Next, youâ€™ll use your debit card to deposit the check.  

### Inserting your debit card and check

Once youâ€™ve arrived at your bank, find the ATM.  Free-standing ATMs often resemble an industrial kiosk approximately a meter in height.  Some financial institutions incorporate ATMs into walls.  Look for signage displaying the initials **ATM**.

Now that youâ€™re at the ATM, follow these steps:

1. Identify the ATMâ€™s screen and read any instructions it displays.
2. Insert your debit card into the slot labeled **card reader**, which is usually illuminated.
3. Locate the ATM keypad, a set of numbers resembling a push-button telephone.
4. When prompted, enter your PIN and press **Enter**.

The ATM verifies your PIN and returns your card.  Retrieve your card and store it safely.

With your identity confirmed, youâ€™re now able to deposit your check with these steps:

1. Using your finger, touch the **Deposit Check** button on the ATM screen.
2. When prompted, insert your check in the ATMâ€™s check receptacle.
3. Confirm the checkâ€™s deposit amount on the ATM screen.
4. When prompted, select the account into which you'll deposit the funds.

The ATM now processes and deposits your check into your bank account.  Remain in front of the ATM to withdraw funds.

### Withdrawing funds

Having deposited your check into your bank account, you can now use the ATM to withdraw cash.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Some banks may not give you immediate access to the full amount you deposited with your check.  See your bank's deposit policies for more information." />}}

To withdraw cash from your bank account, follow these steps:

1. Using your finger, touch the **Make a Withdrawal** button on the ATM screen.
2. The ATM presents you with withdrawal amounts.  Select **$100**.
3. The ATM prompts you to confirm the amount.  Touch the **Confirm** button.
4. The ATM discharges your cash via the cash dispenser.  Retrieve your cash.

At this point, the ATM returns to its main screen.  Using your finger, touch the **Finish Session** button.  If the ATM provides you with a receipt, collect it before leaving.

## Next steps

Youâ€™ve now completed your first ATM transaction, having successfully deposited a check and then withdrawn funds in cash.  

While many people limit their ATM usage to these essential tasks, ATMs allow you to engage in a wide range of financial activities that can simplify your banking visits even further.
