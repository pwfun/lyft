## Getting started

This guide will teach you how to use an automated teller machine to perform basic banking functions.

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll know how to deposit a check into your bank account and use your debit card to withdraw cash.  No prior experience is necessary.

To get the most out of this guide, make sure to have the following on hand:

* **A check made out to you**
* **Your debit card**
* **Your debit card PIN number**

Youâ€™ll use all three as you follow an example use case of withdrawing funds after depositing an **old-age pension check** (OAP) into your bank account.

## Understanding ATMs

**Automated teller machines** (ATMs) allow you to carry out financial services without the assistance of bank personnel.  ATMs offer banking convenience in several situations:

* When youâ€™re unable to attend a bank during its business hours
* When youâ€™re unable to wait in line to speak with banking staff
* When communication with banking staff proves difficult

Using an ATM, you can accomplish a wide range of transactions, including check deposits, cash withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries.

Next, youâ€™ll learn how to prepare for your ATM transaction.

## Using an ATM for the first time

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The Tutorial is intended for novice to intermediate users." />}}

Suppose youâ€™ve received your OAP check in the mail and need to withdraw funds from it.  You can use an ATM to achieve both in a minimal amount of time in three stages:

1. **Preparing for ATM use**
2. **Inserting your debit card and check**
3. **Withdrawing funds**

### Preparing for ATM use

To simplify and streamline your ATM transaction, follow these steps **before** arriving at your bank:

* Confirm that the check you wish to deposit displays your legal name.
* Endorse your check by signing its back with a pen.
* Verify your debit cardâ€™s personal identification number (PIN).
* Locate the ATM youâ€™ll use for your transaction.

Youâ€™ll often find ATMs at your bankâ€™s entrance, though some branches place them in outdoor car lanes for ease of access without leaving your vehicle.

Next, youâ€™ll learn how to deposit a check into an ATM.  

### Inserting your debit card and check

Once youâ€™ve arrived at your bank, find the ATM.  Free-standing ATMs often resemble a box approximately a meter in height.  Some financial institutions incorporate ATMs into walls.  Look for signage displaying the word ATM, then approach the ATM.

Now that youâ€™re at the ATM, insert your debit card and follow these steps:

1. Identify the ATMâ€™s screen and read any instructions it displays.
2. Insert your debit card into the card reader, which is usually illuminated.
3. Locate the ATM keypad, a set of numbers resembling a push-button telephone.
4. When prompted, enter your PIN and press **Enter**.

The ATM verifies your PIN and returns your card to you.  At this point, you may retrieve your card and put it away.

With your identify confirmed, youâ€™re now able to deposit your check with these steps:

1. Using your finger, touch the **Deposit Check** button on the ATM screen.
2. When prompted, insert your check in the ATMâ€™s check receptacle.
3. Confirm the checkâ€™s deposit amount on the ATM screen.
4. When prompted, select the account into which you wish to deposit the funds.

The ATM now processes and deposits your check into your bank account.  Remain in front of the ATM to withdraw funds.

### Withdrawing funds

Having deposited your check into your bank account, you can now use the ATM to withdraw cash.

To withdraw cash from your bank account, follow these steps:

1. Using your finger, touch the **Make a Withdrawal** button on the ATM screen.
2. The ATM presents you with withdrawal amounts.  Select your amount.
3. The ATM prompts you to confirm the amount.  Touch the **Confirm** button.
4. The ATM discharges your cash via the cash dispenser.  Retrieve your cash.
